JavaScript is one of the most versatile programming languages in the world. It is used for front-end web development, back-end development, and even mobile app development. In recent years, there has been a rise in the popularity of JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular, and Vue. While these frameworks can be helpful in certain situations, it's important to remember that they are built on top of JavaScript. By focusing too much on the framework and not enough on the language itself, you may be missing out on the full capabilities of JavaScript.

One of the main benefits of focusing on JavaScript is that it allows you to understand how the framework works. Frameworks are often built on top of JavaScript and use the language's features to function. By understanding the underlying language, you'll be able to better understand how the framework works and how to troubleshoot any issues that may arise. Additionally, when you understand JavaScript, you'll be able to use it for other types of development, such as back-end development. A great example of this is the use of Node.js which is a JavaScript runtime that allows developers to run JavaScript on the server-side.

Another advantage of focusing on JavaScript is that it allows for greater flexibility. Frameworks can be useful for certain types of projects, but they can also be restrictive. When you focus on JavaScript, you'll have a greater understanding of how to create and manipulate elements on a web page. This can be especially useful when working with dynamic data or creating custom UI components. As a developer, you can create your own solutions rather than relying on a pre-built framework.

Furthermore, JavaScript's flexibility allows for a wide variety of use cases. From browser-based web development to server-side scripting with Node.js, desktop application development with Electron and even IoT applications with Node-RED. By understanding the language, you'll be able to take on a wider range of projects and expand your skill set.

Finally, focusing on JavaScript can make you a more well-rounded developer. JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages in the world, and it's used in a wide variety of projects. By understanding the language, you'll be able to take on a wider range of projects and expand your skill set. Additionally, knowing JavaScript can also be helpful when working with other languages, as many of them have similar syntax and concepts.

In conclusion, while JavaScript frameworks can be helpful, it's important to remember that they are built on top of JavaScript. By focusing too much on the framework and not enough on the language itself, you may be missing out on the full capabilities of JavaScript. By focusing on the language, you'll be able to understand how the framework works, be more flexible, and become a more well-rounded developer. Here are a few resources to help you dive deeper into JavaScript:

In addition to these resources, you can also find many tutorials and articles on JavaScript on sites such as [FreeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/) and [CodeAcademy](https://www.codecademy.com/)

As a final note, it's important to remember that frameworks come and go, but the underlying language remains. By focusing on JavaScript, you'll be equipping yourself with the skills and knowledge that will be useful no matter what framework is currently in vogue. Additionally, by focusing on the language, you'll be able to easily pick up new frameworks as they arise, since they'll likely be built on top of the concepts you already understand.

In short, while frameworks can be helpful, it's important to remember that they are built on top of JavaScript. By focusing on the language, you'll be able to understand how the framework works, be more flexible, and become a more well-rounded developer. So, if you're looking to improve your skills as a developer, consider focusing on JavaScript and less on frameworks.
